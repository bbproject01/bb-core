export const metadata = ["IN", "BloomBeans Insurance is a Crypto Financial Asset (CFA) within the BloomBeans Financial Ecosystem, introducing a novel decentralized approach to managing insurance. It's designed for those looking to safeguard against everyday risks. What sets this product apart is its approach, leveraging the power of compound interest. This strategy encourages long-term investment, suggesting users withdraw only in dire situations. Unlike typical insurance that covers specific, less common events, BloomBeans Insurances provides complete coverage without the complexity of fine print. It promises straightforward payouts, removing the hassle of extensive documentation or proof of ownership. It's not just insurance; it's also an investment opportunity. Your BEAN will grow gradually over time. However, it's important to note that in the early stages, the funds for emergencies might be somewhat limited. As a user, you always have access to your funds. The key is to stay committed and responsible, understanding that this financial tool is most effective when used thoughtfully over time. The prospect of consistent high returns for a continuous 30-year span is an attractive incentive for users to stay invested. All Bloombeans CFAs are fully decentralized, tradeable, can be used as collateral for a loan or simply used to obtain profits, just like any other financial product."];
